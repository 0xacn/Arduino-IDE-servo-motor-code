# Servo Motor Code

Hey guys I'm Shash this is a script I built that spins my motor in different angles/degrees hope you enjoy! :wrench:

> To run this code make sure you have the following:

```
Arduino (doesnt matter what model)
```

```
Servo Motor
```

```
Jumper wires
```
Once you have all of this connected you can clone the code and run it with the arduino IDE 

```
git clone https://ShalomMande/Arduino-IDE-servo-motor-code.git
```

After that open your arduino IDE open the folder where you cloned it run the code and see the result!
